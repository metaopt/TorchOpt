Contributing to TorchOpt
========================


Install Develop Version
-----------------------

To install TorchOpt in an "editable" mode, run

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install -e .

in the main directory. This installation is removable by

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python setup.py develop --uninstall


Lint Check
----------

We use several tools to secure code quality, including

- PEP8 code style: flake8, isort, black;
- Type check: mypy;
- C++ Google-style: cpplint, clang-format;
- License: addlicense;
- Documentation: pydocstyle, doc8.

To make things easier, we create several shortcuts as follows.

To automatically format the code, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    make format

To check if everything conforms to the specification, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    make lint


Test Locally
------------

This command will run automatic tests in the main directory

.. code-block:: bash

    $ make pytest


Documentation
-------------

Documentations are written under the ``docs/`` directory as ReStructuredText (``.rst``) files. ``index.rst`` is the main page. A Tutorial on ReStructuredText can be found `here <https://pythonhosted.org/an_example_pypi_project/sphinx.html>`_.

API References are automatically generated by `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/>`_ according to the outlines under ``docs/api/`` and should be modified when any code changes.

To compile documentation into webpage, run

.. code-block:: bash

    $ make docs

The generated webpage is in ``docs/_build`` and can be viewed with browser (http://localhost:8000/).

Detailed documentation is in https://torchopt.readthedocs.io/zh/latest/.
